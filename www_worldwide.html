		<p>As music soars and people chatter, the three characters each hold their places in the ballroom. Wren stands in one corner, her poofy green dress bright around her as she speaks to Sir Frog, her pet toad. Silas watches the room silently from another corner near the kitchens, nursing a glass of punch. Dinui watches over Lord Oswald Canary as he wanders about the room, talking loudly to everyone he recognises. Wren notices a server that does not match the rest and runs to intercept, diving at their legs and sending him to the ground. The tray they were holding goes flying, hitting Dinui in the helmet. She, of course, grabs the waiter and interrogates them. Armed with the knowledge of the waiter’s professed manager (Dave), she storms to the kitchen whilst holding the waiter like a bedraggled kitten. Dave confesses that she does not know the waiter, so Dinui exits, Wren in tow and Silas following cautiously. After relinquishing the waiter to the guards upon Lord Eshteroth's command, Dinui makes a short explanation and indroduction to the lord. Wren is also acknolwedged by him. The trio begin to scatter back to their original places when behind them they hear a muffled grunt. As they turn around, they can see the tip of a blade protruding from Eshteroth's abdomen. After attempting to exit the room with her charge and finding all the doors locked, Dinui scans the room. Silas moves forward to help Lord Eshteroth, healing the wound but finding himself at a loss as a poison starts to creep through the lord's veins.</p>
		<p>Dinui catches a glimpse of a flash through the balcony window and runs to the door, picking the lock esily and swiftly grappling down to the ground. Wren follows down the rope, spotting footprints on the ground. Back inside, an alchemist is found and takes over care of Lord Eshteroth. Silas, released from his duty, follows the other two onto the balcony but finds a staircase to descend more safely. Once all have reached the ground, they follow the footsteps into town.</p>
		<p>Finding an alley of suspicious nature, they follow it to a door into a warehouse. (Dinui finds a new distaste for Sir Frog after he croaks during their attempt to be stealthy) They see a faint light and move towards it. Peeking around the edge of a pile of crates, they see a familiar cloak and listen as two people in all black talk, discussing the 'mission' and planning to return to their boss.</p>
		<p>following the two as they exit the warehouse, our trio traverse a night markek-turned-festival and eventually find themselves at a mansion. Wren gets distracted by the colourful stalls, discovering a seller of tiny hats that fit Sir Frog quite well. Dinui continues following her prey in through the servants' door, Silas in tow. They make their way up the stairs and into the lord's office. Listening in, they discover that Lord Query hired these two to attack and kill Lord Eshteroth. At this, Dinui bursts through the door and puts on an act, pretending to be the pair's boss and demanding her cut of the money. She manages to trick query and drags the two out by the ears. </p>
		<p>She throws the two to the ground and begins to interrogate them before realising they are younger than she thought, barely 17 or 18. As she pauses, they ask if she is an Uncle and she balks, confused by the title. Seeing their age, however, she changes tack, trying to convince them to leave their life of crime. She also sees a matching tattoo on each of their upper arms: a black, broken stump, the roots wrapping around the arm. She pushes for answers on this, but recieves little information. They eventually bolt, sprinting down the alley away from her even as she tries to stop them, both with words and her axe. </p>
		<p>Dinui and Silas go to collect Wren from the market, then return together to Lord Eshteroth's manor. They report their findings to the noble's head guard, and Dinui collects her original charge and sets him to bed. Each of the three finds a room in which to bed down, since the guards have locked down the building until they can discover what happened with Lord Eshteroth. <p>
		<p>In the morning, they report to Lord Eshteroth himself, who has healed a small portion overnight. He thanks them for their efforts, then charges them to continue their pursuit and discover all they can.</p>

	<div class="content">
		<p>Beginning with an exit from Lord Eshteroth’s manor and a stop by Lord Canary's home to drop him into the arms of his butler, the three unlikely compatriots attempt to traverse the city. Unfortunately, Dinui has forgotten everything she once knew about traveling within Contrarsi and they end up lost, spending multiple hours trying to find the temple where she believes she has a contact. They find Father Canis and speak with him for a moment, but he has no information on Lord Query or the Family. Exiting that temple, they head back uphill to the governor’s home, where Dinui’s book of contacts had listed a halfling contact named Kreilla. After Kreilla exasperatedly ushered them out of the kitchen, they asked Dinui why she had come back but did not further explain what went on that made it an issue for her to return. After sharing what little information they had, Kreilla returned to the kitchen and sent the trio on their way.</p>
		<p>They went down to the Guard station near the edge of the city and spoke to the Commander, a half-orc gentleman who found himself suddenly interested in Wren. Agreeing to take them out to the jail to speak with the waiter Dinui had apprehended the night before, he prepared a wagon pulled by goats (one of which Wren made friends with) and headed out of the city towards the jail. Wren played bagpipes, keeping wolves from attacking the wagon, and flirted with the commander. She managed to learn a little bit about the Family (that their recent streak of crimes have been out of character, far more violent than usual) and some more about Dinui (who was discovered to have apprehended criminals before, bringing them into the station and dumping them on the Commander’s desk. She also aggressively threatened them during interrogations.)</p>
		<p>When they arrived at the jail, the Commander knocked on the door (Dinui may be able to remember the pattern, if required) and was let in. Two guards sat inside, one productive at the front desk and the other (named gregory, as they learned from the other’s exasperated response) singing depressedly to himself, his hood pulled up to obscure his face. The three went to speak with the prisoner, managing to get some information about an ‘Older Cousin’ who had assigned the three siblings (the human and two half elves) to this mission and was assigning other ‘younger’ Cousins to similar missions. (last that the prisoner saw, the older Cousin was in an alley about a half-hour’s walk from the temple.) They also went to say hello to another prisoner playing harmonica, with whom Wren played a little bit. The trio then headed back to Contrarsi with the Commander, who planned a date for him and Wren the next day. They all found rooms in an inn near the stables where Dinui’s horse is being housed and went to sleep. </p>

	<div class="content">
		<p> Waking up the next morning, Silas and Dinui find that Wren has already left for her date. After breakfast, they decide to revisit the temple and ask the Father if he knows anything about this 'older cousin'. They enter at the tail end of a service and wait as he speaks with his flock, finally making his way towards them. They ask for information, but there is unfortunately little he can share. The triplets had visited his church a few times, but they weren't regular enough attendees for him to really know them or any of their friends. As he speaks, however, a feather catches Dinui's eye, caught in the windowframe. Through the window, she sees a furtive bird-person ducking into an alley just down the street. They thank the Father for his time and swiftly move down the street, pausing only to speak with a baker at his stall and ask about the individual that just ran past. The baker, who is revealed to be named Mr. Triscuit, confesses that he doesn't know anything about him but confirms that he did duck into the alley that Dinui noticed. As they step into the alley, they can see someone at the other end, trying to climb up the wall and escape through one of the windows within the alley. They attempt to beat him, but he proves to be a hardy challenger. Dinui and Silas are running out of energy when, through the open window of the top floor to their left, a spell shoots into their quarry and floors him, leaving him babbling softly on the ground.</p>
		<p>The figures look down from above as Dinui takes the time to tie up the aaracokra, then looks up at them and demands answers. They move away from the window, during which time Dinui begins to ask the bird man questions but recieves only madness in response, his mind clearly broken from a combination of his wounds and trauma that dives much deeper. The figures reappear a few moments later at the bottom of the building and move to stand across from Dinui. They introduce themselves as Mr. D and Mrs. A, and confirm (after Dinui's interrogation) that they are associated with the Family. They look sadly at the man on the ground, confessing that he- James -had once been a member of their group, until something made him turn against them and convince others to join him. This broken-off branch of their family commited crimes and took jobs that even the Family refused to take, sullying their name by continuing to use their titles and by tattooing the stump symbol on each member of their splinter. Mr. D compliments Silas and Dinui on their fighting and investigative skills, then takes the trussed body of James and they promise to care for him as well as they can while ensuring he doesnt cause any more damage. Dinui also asks that they gather the triplets, and Mr. D agrees, sharing that the triplets were in fact the children of some members of the Family. They had left to join James' group because they had been prevented from joining the Family yet due to their young age and they hated it. After carefully placing James into a storage sphere, the four walk back out of the alley, following the scent of bread and sweets back to Mr. Triscuit's stall where D&A are recognized as friends. Dinui and Silas share pieces of their story, enough that Mr. Triscuit hands them an olive loaf, asking them to deliver it to Lord Eshteroth (by which they also learn that olive bread is Eshteroth's favourite) with his best wishes for a speedy recovery.</p>
		<p>The Family may call upon Dinui and Silas again in times of need. Lord Eshteroth is deeply appreciative of the efforts of this unlikely trio, and it seems a sort of business relationship has been formed between them. Each member of this small party returns to their respective home, ready for some rest after so much excitement.</p>

	<div class="content2">
		<p> Wellie Buttons sees a poster advertising a free concert in the next town over. He decides to go, hoping that perhaps some music will help lead him to his god. He notices, however, that the members of the orchestra seem somehow wrong, stiff and emotionless despite the beauty and movement of their music. He casts a spell, hoping to bring some good, but as the echoes of calming magic shimmer through the room, it instead causes the orchestra to screech to a halt, each member turning to glare at the concertmaster and conductor. Evan, having been playing a viola, stands and smashes it over the concertmaster's head. Lavinia stands too, pushing through the crowd towards backstage. The entire building has erupted into chaos by this point, spectators shoving their way out of the room and orchestra members in disarray. Some join Evan in pushing towards the Concertmaster and the Conductor, while others break down, staring into nothingness. Wellie jumps on stage to try and help, ducking beneath the wild punch that Evan next swings at the Concertmaster. The Conductor runs backstage as well, transforming into a hawk before Lavinia can stop him and fleeing through a high window. The Concertmaster manages to escape the crush of people, jumping from the stage and running for the door. Wellie and Evan try to follow but cannot catch up, especially when the Concertmaster casts a Stinking Cloud behind him to stall them.</p> 
		<p>Realising that they have no hope to catch them, they meet back up and Wellie offers his home as a safe place to stay and recuperate overnight. They manage to catch a ride back home with a farmer named Gregory (who afterwards swears off ever offering rides to strangers again), then stay the night with Meemaw, Wellie's grandma.</p>

	<div class="content2">
		<p>The group leaves Bottleneck the next morning, returning to the town where the concert was in search of clues. After asking around, they find that their best bet for information will be to visit City Hall and speak with a council member. After speaking with the secretary, they are directed to John, who is the council member that handles the paperwork, such as renting out city buildings. They explain who they are and what they are trying to do, and he agrees to help them. He grabs the file about the concert hall, which was conveniently already on his desk, and opens it. he sifts through the papers, trying to find a specific contract. He looks again, then a third time, but to no avail. John looks back up at the party helplessly, and they wonder out loud if it might have been stolen. He says the only people who had been there between when he had last seen the page and now was a couple of people, both of whose names start with C. The trio goes to the concert hall in hope of extra clues to work with. </p>
		<p>Heading backstage, they find empty instrument cases and a door that wasn't there last time. They decide to try the door. </p>
		<p>As they enter the door, it swings shut behind them. They find themselves in what seems to be the front room of a mansion, complete with a painting of a rich couple. They find another door and go through it, finding themselves in a tiled room, each square marked with a small design. Wellie tries to sprint across the room, swiftly getting shot with arrows hidden in the walls. As he returns to the safety of the doorway, the other two look at the tiles, the designs looking familiar- and they realise that they match the designs carved into the crown molding in the previous room. All match save one, so they step carefully on the first tile with that design on it. No traps trigger, so they all carefully venture across the room, even taking the time to open a chest they find. Inside was a vial of green liquid and a wide belt.</p>
		<p>Finally pushing through the next door, the trio find themselves in a stone room, cells lined along one wall and a desk on the opposite. Resting on the desk is a violin, finely made and still shining beneath the thin coating of dust that lays on everything. Evan picks up the violin to take with them. They walk through the room to the next door and open it to see a dark tunnel, carved stone curving above them. They step in, looking around to see wooden mining supports holding the walls. They also see a time clock, a rack of cards carefully attached to the stone beside it. As they look through the cards, each has clocked out and there is only one name that begins with a C. Continuing on after gathering this information, they find a cavernous crack in the floor dividing them from the next door. Wellie ties a rope around his waist and tries to leap across, failing and finding himself caught about 10 feet above the bottom of the ravine. He sees nothing down there save for a pickaxe, the haft broken from the head. They manage to pull him back up and eventually cross the gap, then push through another door into a tavern, empty but still stocked. They rest here for a time and, while sitting down, notice a small wand and a music note carved into the wood of the table. After they all feel sufficiently rested, they push through the next door into another section of prison, formed from the same stone as the previous. Looking into the cells, they find some clothing and a chipped off piece of tusk. </p>

	<button type="button" class="collapsible">C1 Session 4 (September 21 2023)</button>
	<div class="content">
		<p>Dinui is on guard duty at her temple, pacing a dent into the grass where she walks her constant observatory path. Out of the forest, as if blown by the wind, flutters a piece of paper. She grabs it and reads it- a plea for help, with a small symbol of the Family sketched in the corner -then looks towards where it came from and sees the mouth of a cave, unseen before despite her knowledge of these woods. She prepares herself and then enters, finding at first what seems to be a simple cave, a straight tunnel sloping slightly downwards as she moves. The stone slowly begins to transition to tiles, miniscule and intricately placed in mosaics all around the tunnel. She comes to a door, out of place amongst the tile. it looks like an interior door, something that might be found in the hallway of a house. Apprehensively, she reaches out to open the door.  </p>
		<p>Silas is fishing peacefully, gazing up at the stars as he waits for a pull on the line. A small glow catches his attention, shining from just beside his boat. He reaches into the water and finds it to be a small note, a plea for assistance with a small symbol of the Family sketched in the corner. He looks back at the water, where remnants of the luminesence remain, and follows them to the mouth of a cave from which ripples a small creek. He steps into the cave, following the hallway and the faint remnants of light until he comes to a door. This door is out of place in a cave, as it looks like an internal door from a house. To the left of the door, sourced from a hole in the ceiling, falls the water that carried the small note to him. He looks into the hole but sees nothing, then resigns himself to the door, reaching out to open it. </p>
		<p> The two open doors to the same room, both scanning the area quickly before speaking. It seems to be a bedroom, suitable for a manor though clearly not intended for the owner thereof. After a quick moment of chat, they look about but find no clues to what or where this place is, save for another door that leads to an unknown location. </p>
		<p>As they push through the door, they find themselves in a storage room, kegs piled in neat stacks around them. Across the room is another door but before they step towards it, Dinui marks the door behind them with a large X in chalk. The next door they push through gets similarly marked, and they find themselves in a stone room with a desk and little else. By the materials and the few papers on the desk, they ascertain that this is- or was -the intake room for a jail. Walking through the next door across from them, and of course marking the back of it (this will continue throughout the session. Consider every door passed through as marked.), they find themselves in an octagonal room with a door on each wall. They find small marks of movement at the second from the left and walk through it. Warm wood meets them, beams supporting a room filled by a large table, carved with a map of the world. Upon one wall is etched a large symbol of the Family, the roots spreading across almost the entire wall. The map is marked with small flags on seemingly random locations- though there is at least one on every continent -and Dinui marks down the flagged points. They find some evidence that someone had rested here, but the person has already left with all their gear. Silas mervels at the lack of opposition they have met, then moves towards the next door. He opens it to find a mine tunnel, stone walls cut into a sharp square around them. As they start to walk, they hear a horrid squelching sound and watch as a gelatinous cube oozes closer to them down the hallway. Suddenly comprehending what made such perfect corners in the stone, the two prepare to fight. Silas prepares his crossbow and looses a firey shot and Dinui slashes at it, hoping to cut through it and create a tunnel for them. When this does not stop the creature, the fighter shoves into the creature, wriggling about with her axe to try and force a hole through it. Though this effort is not terribly effective, the combination of her slashing and casting along with Silas' shots manage to defeat the creature before Dinui succumbs to her acid burns. They venture down the hallway and find- what else -another door. Stepping through it they find themselves in what seems to be a room in an inn, cots lined along the wall and a basin of water at the end. Dinui strips and washes herself and her armour, then they rest for a short time before pushing through the next door. Here they find a carpeted hallway, a small table on one side but little else.</p>

	<button type="button2" class="collapsible2"> C2 Session 3 (October 18 2023)</button>
	<div class="content2">
		<p>As they pass through the next door, Wellie, Lavinia, and Evan find themselves in a finely-appointed bedroom. A large four-poster bed rests in the middle of the room across from a family portrait depicting a mother, father, and two sons. On the mantle beneath it, however, is a vase with dried flowers that reach up to cover one of the sons. Evan manages to identify him as the Concertmaster, and the trio moves on through the next door. They find themselves in a warehouse filled with crates, several opened on the side showing that they are filled with violin bodies, bridges, and strings. Despite these open crates, Wellie breaks into another box just to find another stack of violins. Passing through the next door, they find themselves in a stone room as the door locks behind them. The exit is locked, with a riddle carved into it. Evan manages to guess the answer nigh-immediately with a joke, unlocking the knob under Lavinia's forceful shake. The next room is new, the texture and colour of the wall strange to the adventurers. Looking closer, they find that it looks almost like skin, though lacking hair and pores. All are disgusted (especially Lavinia) and walk swiftly down the hall in search of an exit. They find an old mining elevator and pile into it, Lavinia winding the metal box up the shaft as quickly as they can. They exit into another fleshy room, but find a door and quickly enter it. The find themselves in another wing of the now-familiar prison, they find more empty cells and another door leading further into the dungeon. They find themselves in what seems to be a jungle, the air humid and trees arching over them. As they push forward into the greenery, they find themselves beset by a flock of birds that begin divebombing them. Lavinia and Evan begin battling them while Wellie runs for the door, hoping for an escape. Finding that it is locked and needs all three party members to open it. He turns back and launches spells to assist the others in their avian battle. A huge canary joins the fray just as the flock is beginning to flag, swooping from the trees in an attempt to injure them all. Lavinia manages to take down the canary, nigh-bisecting it with her axe. The efforts of all manage to defeat the last of the birds, and the party all reconvenes at the door to turn the knobs. Rather than the door opening, however, the wall above them opens to reveal a dark space within. They theorise about what could be within for a moment before something leans out. </p>
		<p>Wellie speaks the most with him, perpetually respectful and curious. They learn that the place they are in is called The Dungeon, and the owl lets them through the door after a request from the party. Through the door is another block of the prison, and Wellie (convinced that the prison must have some sort of importance) starts going into each cell before Lavinia and Evan open the door and he goes running after them. They find themselves in a room tiled with tiny pieces of colourful ceramic and glass, swirling together to create a beautiful mosaic with an aquatic motif. On the other end of the room appears to be a deep tub or pool in the ground, which in concert with the mosaic evokes a sense of Roman baths for the players. Lavinia takes a step into the room and triggers a trap, a blade from the wall slicing through the air. They try to brainstorm a plan to cross safely, Wellie debating just sprinting across the floor and taking whatever damage he gets. Instead, Lavinia scoops him up and throws him (despite his efforts otherwise) and manages to get him about 20 feet- still 10 feet from the pool and the exit. Lavinia looks back down at the tiles beneath her feet to try and assess what tripped the trap and discovers that is was a patch of a specific shade of green tile. She points this out to the other two, and Wellie (unfortunately not understanding the clue) makes his way the last few feet to the edge of the pool. Lavinia directs Evan and the two of them manage to make it across the room safely and come to stand next to Wellie. He, angered by the throw from earlier, tries to push Lavinia into the pool but fails, after which she kicks him in and his armour scrapes against the tiles as he slides to the bottom. He is enraged by this and breaks, shooting a guiding bolt at her and initiating combat. She tries to make peace, but he continues to push, eventually killing her and watching as she falls, Evan still watching from the side. A swift wash of emotion floods over Wellie- a deep, broken disappointment that he somehow inherently knows is from his god. He scrambles up the side of the pool and pushes a healing spell into Lavinia, saving her from the death he brough upon her. She is boiling with rage, but chooses to take a moment to pray to the Blue and ask what she should do. A soft wash of calm rolls over her, cooling her anger and convincing her to leave Wellie alive. Everyone manages to at least not be at each others throats anymore, but it will take some time before they can start to trust each other again.</p>
