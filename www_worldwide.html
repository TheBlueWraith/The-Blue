		<p>As music soars and people chatter, the three characters each hold their places in the ballroom. Wren stands in one corner, her poofy green dress bright around her as she speaks to sir frog, her pet toad. Silas watches the room silently from another corner near the kitchens, nursing a glass of punch. Dinui watches over Lord Oswald Canary as he wanders about the room, talking loudly to everyone he recognises. Wren notices a server that does not match the rest and runs to intercept, diving at their legs and sending him to the ground. The tray they were holding goes flying, hitting Dinui in the helmet. She, of course, grabs the waiter and interrogates them. Armed with the knowledge of the waiter’s professed manager (Dave), she storms to the kitchen whilst holding the waiter like a bedraggled kitten. Dave confesses that she does not know the waiter, so Dinui exits, Wren in tow and Silas following cautiously. </p>

		<p>Beginning with an exit from Lord Eshteroth’s manor, the three unlikely compatriots attempt to traverse the city. Unfortunately, Dinui has forgotten everything she once knew about traveling within Contrarsi and they end up lost, spending multiple hours trying to find the temple where she believes she has a contact. They find Father Canis and speak with him for a moment, but he has no information on Lord Query or the Family. Exiting that temple, they head back uphill to the governor’s home, where Dinui’s book of contacts had listed a halfling contact named Kreilla. After Kreilla exasperatedly ushered them out of the kitchen, they asked Dinui why she had come back but did not further explain what went on that made it an issue for her to return. After sharing what little information they had, Kreilla returned to the kitchen and sent the trio on their way.</p>
		<p>They went down to the Guard station near the edge of the city and spoke to the Commander, a half-orc gentleman who found himself suddenly interested in Wren. Agreeing to take them out to the jail to speak with the waiter Dinui had apprehended the night before, he prepared a wagon pulled by goats (one of which Wren made friends with) and headed out of the city towards the jail. Wren played bagpipes, keeping wolves from attacking the wagon, and flirted with the commander. She managed to learn a little bit about the Family (that their recent streak of crimes have been out of character, far more violent than usual) and some more about Dinui (who was discovered to have apprehended criminals before, bringing them into the station and dumping them on the Commander’s desk. She also aggressively threatened them during interrogations.)</p>
		<p>When they arrived at the jail, the Commander knocked on the door (Dinui may be able to remember the pattern, if required) and was let in. Two guards sat inside, one productive at the front desk and the other (named gregory, as they learned from the other’s exasperated response) singing depressedly to himself, his hood pulled up to obscure his face. The three went to speak with the prisoner, managing to get some information about an ‘Older Cousin’ who had assigned the three siblings (the human and two half elves) to this mission and was assigning other ‘younger’ Cousins to similar missions. (last that the prisoner saw, the older Cousin was in an alley about a half-hour’s walk from the temple.) They also went to say hello to another prisoner playing harmonica, with whom Wren played a little bit. 
		The trio then headed back to Contrarsi with the Commander, who planned a date for him and Wren the next day. They all found rooms in an inn near the stables where Dinui’s horse is being housed and went to sleep. </p>
