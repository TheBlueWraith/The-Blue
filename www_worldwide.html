		<p>As music soars and people chatter, the three characters each hold their places in the ballroom. Wren stands in one corner, her poofy green dress bright around her as she speaks to Sir Frog, her pet toad. Silas watches the room silently from another corner near the kitchens, nursing a glass of punch. Dinui watches over Lord Oswald Canary as he wanders about the room, talking loudly to everyone he recognises. Wren notices a server that does not match the rest and runs to intercept, diving at their legs and sending him to the ground. The tray they were holding goes flying, hitting Dinui in the helmet. She, of course, grabs the waiter and interrogates them. Armed with the knowledge of the waiter’s professed manager (Dave), she storms to the kitchen whilst holding the waiter like a bedraggled kitten. Dave confesses that she does not know the waiter, so Dinui exits, Wren in tow and Silas following cautiously. After relinquishing the waiter to the guards upon Lord Eshteroth's command, Dinui makes a short explanation and indroduction to the lord. Wren is also acknolwedged by him. The trio begin to scatter back to their original places when behind them they hear a muffled grunt. As they turn around, they can see the tip of a blade protruding from Eshteroth's abdomen. After attempting to exit the room with her charge and finding all the doors locked, Dinui scans the room. Silas moves forward to help Lord Eshteroth, healing the wound but finding himself at a loss as a poison starts to creep through the lord's veins.</p>
		<p>Dinui catches a glimpse of a flash through the balcony window and runs to the door, picking the lock esily and swiftly grappling down to the ground. Wren follows down the rope, spotting footprints on the ground. Back inside, an alchemist is found and takes over care of Lord Eshteroth. Silas, released from his duty, follows the other two onto the balcony but finds a staircase to descend more safely. Once all have reached the ground, they follow the footsteps into town.</p>
		<p>Finding an alley of suspicious nature, they follow it to a door into a warehouse. (Dinui finds a new distaste for Sir Frog after he croaks during their attempt to be stealthy) They see a faint light and move towards it. Peeking around the edge of a pile of crates, they see a familiar cloak and listen as two people in all black talk, discussing the 'mission' and planning to return to their boss.</p>
		<p>following the two as they exit the warehouse, our trio traverse a night markek-turned-festival and eventually find themselves at a mansion. Wren gets distracted by the colourful stalls, discovering a seller of tiny hats that fit Sir Frog quite well. Dinui continues following her prey in through the servants' door, Silas in tow. They make their way up the stairs and into the lord's office. Listening in, they discover that Lord Query hired these two to attack and kill Lord Eshteroth. At this, Dinui bursts through the door and puts on an act, pretending to be the pair's boss and demanding her cut of the money. She manages to trick query and drags the two out by the ears. </p>
		<p>She throws the two to the ground and begins to interrogate them before realising they are younger than she thought, barely 17 or 18. As she pauses, they ask if she is an Uncle and she balks, confused by the title. Seeing their age, however, she changes tack, trying to convince them to leave their life of crime. She also sees a matching tattoo on each of their upper arms: a black, broken stump, the roots wrapping around the arm. She pushes for answers on this, but recieves little information. They eventually bolt, sprinting down the alley away from her even as she tries to stop them, both with words and her axe. </p>
		<p>Dinui and Silas go to collect Wren from the market, then return together to Lord Eshteroth's manor. They report their findings to the noble's head guard, and Dinui collects her original charge and sets him to bed. Each of the three finds a room in which to bed down, since the guards have locked down the building until they can discover what happened with Lord Eshteroth. <p>
		<p>In the morning, they report to Lord Eshteroth himself, who has healed a small portion overnight. He thanks them for their efforts, then charges them to continue their pursuit and discover all they can.</p>

		<p>Beginning with an exit from Lord Eshteroth’s manor and a stop by Lord Canary's home to drop him into the arms of his butler, the three unlikely compatriots attempt to traverse the city. Unfortunately, Dinui has forgotten everything she once knew about traveling within Contrarsi and they end up lost, spending multiple hours trying to find the temple where she believes she has a contact. They find Father Canis and speak with him for a moment, but he has no information on Lord Query or the Family. Exiting that temple, they head back uphill to the governor’s home, where Dinui’s book of contacts had listed a halfling contact named Kreilla. After Kreilla exasperatedly ushered them out of the kitchen, they asked Dinui why she had come back but did not further explain what went on that made it an issue for her to return. After sharing what little information they had, Kreilla returned to the kitchen and sent the trio on their way.</p>
		<p>They went down to the Guard station near the edge of the city and spoke to the Commander, a half-orc gentleman who found himself suddenly interested in Wren. Agreeing to take them out to the jail to speak with the waiter Dinui had apprehended the night before, he prepared a wagon pulled by goats (one of which Wren made friends with) and headed out of the city towards the jail. Wren played bagpipes, keeping wolves from attacking the wagon, and flirted with the commander. She managed to learn a little bit about the Family (that their recent streak of crimes have been out of character, far more violent than usual) and some more about Dinui (who was discovered to have apprehended criminals before, bringing them into the station and dumping them on the Commander’s desk. She also aggressively threatened them during interrogations.)</p>
		<p>When they arrived at the jail, the Commander knocked on the door (Dinui may be able to remember the pattern, if required) and was let in. Two guards sat inside, one productive at the front desk and the other (named gregory, as they learned from the other’s exasperated response) singing depressedly to himself, his hood pulled up to obscure his face. The three went to speak with the prisoner, managing to get some information about an ‘Older Cousin’ who had assigned the three siblings (the human and two half elves) to this mission and was assigning other ‘younger’ Cousins to similar missions. (last that the prisoner saw, the older Cousin was in an alley about a half-hour’s walk from the temple.) They also went to say hello to another prisoner playing harmonica, with whom Wren played a little bit. The trio then headed back to Contrarsi with the Commander, who planned a date for him and Wren the next day. They all found rooms in an inn near the stables where Dinui’s horse is being housed and went to sleep. </p>

		<p> Wellie Buttons sees a poster advertising a free concert in the next town over. He decides to go, hoping that perhaps some music will help lead him to his god. He notices, however, that the members of the orchestra seem somehow wrong, stiff and emotionless despite the beauty and movement of their music. He casts a spell, hoping to bring some good, but as the echoes of calming magic shimmer through the room, it instead causes the orchestra to screech to a halt, each member turning to glare at the concertmaster and conductor. Evan, having been playing a viola, stands and smashes it over the concertmaster's head. Lavinia stands too, pushing through the crowd towards backstage. The entire building has erupted into chaos by this point, spectators shoving their way out of the room and orchestra members in disarray. Some join Evan in pushing towards the Concertmaster and the Conductor, while others break down, staring into nothingness. Wellie jumps on stage to try and help, ducking beneath the wild punch that Evan next swings at the Concertmaster. The Conductor runs backstage as well, transforming into a hawk before Lavinia can stop him and fleeing through a high window. The Concertmaster manages to escape the crush of people, jumping from the stage and running for the door. Wellie and Evan try to follow but cannot catch up, especially when the Concertmaster casts a Stinking Cloud behind him to stall them.</p> 
		<p>Realising that they have no hope to catch them, they meet back up and Wellie offers his home as a safe place to stay and recuperate overnight. They manage to catch a ride back home with a farmer named Gregory (who afterwards swears off ever offering rides to strangers again), then stay the night with Meemaw, Wellie's grandma.</p>

	<div class="content2">
		<p>The group leaves Bottleneck the next morning, returning to the town where the concert was in search of clues. After asking around, they find that their best bet for information will be to visit City Hall and speak with a council member. After speaking with the secretary, they are directed to John, who is the council member that handles the paperwork, such as renting out city buildings. They explain who they are and what they are trying to do, and he agrees to help them. He grabs the file about the concert hall, which was conveniently already on his desk, and opens it. he sifts through the papers, trying to find a specific contract. He looks again, then a third time, but to no avail. John looks back up at the party helplessly, and they wonder out loud if it might have been stolen. He says the only people who had been there between when he had last seen the page and now was a couple of people, both of whose names start with C. The trio goes to the concert hall in hope of extra clues to work with. </p>
		<p>Heading backstage, they find empty instrument cases and a door that wasn't there last time. They decide to try the door. </p>
		<p>As they enter the door, it swings shut behind them. They find themselves in what seems to be the front room of a mansion, complete with a painting of a rich couple. They find another door and go through it, finding themselves in a tiled room, each square marked with a small design. Wellie tries to sprint across the room, swiftly getting shot with arrows hidden in the walls. As he returns to the safety of the doorway, the other two look at the tiles, the designs looking familiar- and they realise that they match the designs carved into the crown molding in the previous room. All match save one, so they step carefully on the first tile with that design on it. No traps trigger, so they all carefully venture across the room, even taking the time to open a chest they find. Inside was a vial of green liquid and a wide belt.</p>
		<p>Finally pushing through the next door, the trio find themselves in a stone room, cells lined along one wall and a desk on the opposite. Resting on the desk is a violin, finely made and still shining beneath the thin coating of dust that lays on everything. Evan picks up the violin to take with them. They walk through the room to the next door and open it to see a dark tunnel, carved stone curving above them. They step in, looking around to see wooden mining supports holding the walls. They also see a time clock, a rack of cards carefully attached to the stone beside it. As they look through the cards, each has clocked out and there is only one name that begins with a C. Continuing on after gathering this information, they find a cavernous crack in the floor dividing them from the next door. Wellie ties a rope around his waist and tries to leap across, failing and finding himself caught about 10 feet above the bottom of the ravine. He sees nothing down there save for a pickaxe, the haft broken from the head. They manage to pull him back up and eventually cross the gap, then push through another door into a tavern, empty but still stocked. They rest here for a time and, while sitting down, notice a small wand and a music note carved into the wood of the table. After they all feel sufficiently rested, they push through the next door into another section of prison, formed from the same stone as the previous. Looking into the cells, they find some clothing and a chipped off piece of tusk. </p>
